This is a program to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing:
1. "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3
2. "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5
3. "FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15
4. "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime
5. Value of F(n) otherwise

Assumptions:
1. The fibonacci number is first checked to be divisible by 15. If not it is checked against 3 and 5.
2. If all the divisible conditions fail, only then the number is checked to be a prime.
3. The only exception to these rules is the value 0.

The executable when run takes a user input as one of the options for the value of n and prints out one of the above options.
Executable location - /swift_fizzbuzzfib/Debug/swift_fizzbuzzfib.exe

Dependancy - GNU c++ library - headers used are iostream and cstdlib

Testing - The executable when run provides the user an option to generate a random value for n (in the range 0-100) and print out one of the above options.
The value along with the reason one of the strings was printed is displayed for verification.

Example:
